# Security-System-Using Arduino

The present study has been made to suggest and develop some tools which will eventually be useful to the security firms to provide safety and security at reasonable cost and of a specified quality. This project is targeted towards financing, designing, implementing and operating security facilities and services that were traditionally expensive and complicated yet with many loopholes. This project aims to provide cost effective security solutions to everyone ranging from home security solutions to providing security to large MNCâ€™s. As this project is simple to operate anyone with some basic knowledge of computers can operate this. Also because one server has to be maintained over which the whole system will be based and operate for that particular client maintenance is largely reduced. As arduino boards and components are the main building blocks of this system, this product highly cost-effective and easy to mass produce.
